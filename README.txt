Roll: CS17B103

Running:
Attched python script files: taxi_fare_<device_name>.py
(also have the jupyter notebook file for TPU program)
Can directly be copied to google colab or run in local computer(cpu only) if libraries are present.
Dataset is being read from google drive. (can be modified to the tester's location for testing purpose).
File result.py contains the requied metrics saved(rounded up) (used tqdm for some details). Any plot part can be uncommented and run to generate the respective plot.

I assure you of the data being "unadulterated" and "academic honesty" for the assignment and observations, program can be run and similar results can be obtained(getting exact results is near impossible anyways) 
Online references were used regarding use and understanding of Tensorflow library.
Used tensorflow version 1.x
no high level libraries used (keras/pytorch)
used numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tqdm and sklearn.
